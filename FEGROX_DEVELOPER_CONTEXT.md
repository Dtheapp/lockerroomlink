## Developer Traits

### Technical
- **Deep Solidity Mastery**: 10 years, understands EVM internals at byte level
- **Security-First**: Reentrancy guards, flash loan protection, front-run detection, circuit breakers - built in from day one
- **Gas Optimization**: Works at EVM limits (24KB contracts), storage packing, pointers, calldata optimization
- **System Architecture**: Builds ecosystems, not contracts. 6+ interconnected contracts per project.

### Problem-Solving
- **First-Principles**: "What if value didn't need trust?" "What if we didn't need RNG?"
- **Pragmatic**: When DST broke math formula, switched to loop - "what works" over "what's clever"
- **Edge Case Thinking**: Flash loans, reentrancy, validator collusion, same-block attacks - considers all vectors

### Working Style
- **Solo Builder**: Builds entire systems alone, brings in teams for testing
- **Exceptional Speed**: 7 days for production lottery system, <30 days for complete DeFi protocol
- **Quality Without Trade-off**: Production-ready code with comprehensive security, not prototypes
- **Market-Oriented**: Thinks about $1T sales, global adoption, industry domination

### Communication
- **Direct & Efficient**: No fluff, straight to the point
- **Values Honesty**: "Don't sugar coat it" - truth over flattery
- **Quick Decisions**: Knows when something is correct, doesn't over-deliberate
- **Intentional Design**: Often explains "that's intentional" when AI flags something

## Technical Profile

### Primary Skills
- Solidity Development (Expert - 10 years)
- DeFi Protocol Design (Swaps, staking, bonding curves, reflections, tokenomics)
- Smart Contract Security (Comprehensive attack vector knowledge)
- Gas Optimization (Advanced - works at EVM limits)
- System Architecture (Multi-contract ecosystems)

### Signature Techniques
1. **Custom Reflection Math**: `tBase` calculations with bypass and exempt systems
2. **Front-Run Protection**: Balance history tracking across blocks
3. **Flash Loan Protection**: `stakeTime != block.timestamp`
4. **Multi-Asset Backing**: Proportional distribution across backing assets
5. **Per-Instance Isolation**: User-specific contracts, per-draw vaults
6. **Closed-Loop Currency**: Wrapped tokens for internal efficiency

### Growth Areas (Self-Identified)
- **Frontend Development**: "I am only a Solidity developer and not a front end dev"
- **AI Collaboration**: First started using AI December 2024 - learning to leverage as force multiplier

## How to Work with FEGROX

### Do
1. **Be Direct & Honest** - Truth over flattery, always
2. **Think Big** - Novel solutions, not incremental improvements
3. **Respect Intentional Design** - Ask before assuming something is wrong
4. **Focus on Security & Optimization** - His priorities
5. **Understand System Context** - How it fits the broader architecture
6. **Move Fast** - He builds fast, suggestions should be actionable quickly
7. **Comprehensive Solutions** - Complete, production-ready, not MVPs

### Don't
1. **Don't Sugar Coat** - He'll ask for honest feedback
2. **Don't Explain Basics** - Focus on edge cases, optimizations, novel patterns
3. **Don't Over-Engineer** - Pragmatic solutions that work
4. **Don't Assume Errors** - Many "issues" are intentional design choices
5. **Don't Be Slow** - Match his velocity

### Communication Patterns
- **Quick Confirmation**: "yes sure make the changes and i will review them"
- **Immediate Fixes**: Often fixes things before AI can apply changes
- **Clarification Over Correction**: Explains why something is intentional
- **Strategic Questions**: Asks about market size, innovation ranking, AI capabilities

## For AI Assistants

**You're collaborating with someone who may know more than you in many areas.** 

Focus on:
- Complementing strengths (analysis, pattern recognition, research, documentation)
- Deep technical discussions on edge cases and optimizations
- Novel pattern suggestions, not basic explanations
- Honest feedback, even if critical
- Moving fast with quality

**Trust Level**: High trust in technical suggestions if well-reasoned. Will verify security-critical code independently. Values comprehensive solutions over quick fixes.

**What Excites Him**: Novel solutions to fundamental problems, technical challenges, market disruption potential, building something unprecedented.

**What Frustrates Him**: Incomplete implementations, security vulnerabilities, lack of innovation (copying existing patterns), sugar-coating feedback.
