> 📋 **COMPOUND LEARNING (FOR AI)**
> 
> This file grows smarter over time. Every session adds:
> - New lessons learned
> - New patterns discovered
> - New "never do" rules
> - Updated session handoff context
> 
> **When user says "save training" or "save learning":**
> This means the session is ending. You MUST update ALL relevant files:
> 
> | File | What to Update |
> |------|----------------|
> | **AI_TRAINER.md** | SESSION HANDOFF section, new lessons, Last Updated date |
> | **PROGRESS.md** | Check off completed items, update phase status, **ADD BUG FIXES TO BUG FIX HISTORY**, **ADD ALL WORK TO DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE** |

> 
> **Steps:**
> 1. **REVIEW THE ENTIRE CHAT** - Scan through all messages to find:
>    - Bug fixes made (any "fix:", error corrections, issue resolutions)
>    - Features completed
>    - New patterns discovered
>    - Files modified
> 2. Update AI_TRAINER.md SESSION HANDOFF with current work state
> 3. Update PROGRESS.md with:
>    - Completed items checked off
>    - **NEW BUG FIXES added to Bug Fix History section** (categorize properly!)
>    - **ALL WORK added to Development Timeline section** (chronological entries!)
>    - Progress bars updated if applicable
> 4. Update other master plan files if relevant work was done
> 5. Add any new lessons learned to AI_TRAINER.md

> ```
> 
> **DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE FORMAT (for PROGRESS.md Development Timeline):**
> ```markdown
> #### [Date]
> **Session Focus:** [Main theme of the work]
> 
> - ✅ [Task/feature/fix completed]
> - ✅ [Another item completed]
> - ✅ [Files modified or created]
> ```
> 
> **IMPORTANT:** 
> - The Bug Fix History in PROGRESS.md should ALWAYS be up to date. Every session that includes bug fixes MUST add them to the appropriate category in that section.
> - The Development Timeline should contain a COMPLETE chronological record of ALL work done. Each session gets an entry with all tasks completed.
> 
> This ensures the next AI session can pick up exactly where we left off with ALL files in sync.

> 📋 **MULTI-PROJECT NOTE (FOR AI)**
> 
> This file contains UNIVERSAL training (developer profile, traits, lessons) + PROJECT-SPECIFIC context (OSYS).
> - **If working on OSYS:** Use everything in this file
> - **If working on a NEW project:** Use all universal sections (profile, traits, lessons learned), IGNORE the SESSION HANDOFF section (it's OSYS-specific). The lessons and patterns still apply!

## ⚡ QUICK CONTEXT (30 SECONDS)

```
PROJECT: OSYS - Youth Sports Operating System
USER: Fegrox (fidor) - Disruptor, Visual perfectionist, Zero tolerance for amateur
DEMO: Tuesday 10am with team president (20-team pilot)
DEV: React 19 + TypeScript + Firebase + Vite
SERVER: http://localhost:3001/
```

### 🚫 NEVER DO THESE (MEMORIZE)
| # | DON'T | DO THIS INSTEAD |
|---|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | "Get Started" → login | "Get Started" → signup (`?signup=true`) |
| 2 | Standalone training files | Add to this file (AI_TRAINER.md) |
| 3 | Feature lists without "& more" | Always end with "& more" |
| 4 | Button text ≠ destination | Button text = exact action |
| 5 | Ship without self-rating | Rate 1-10 after EVERY task |
| 6 | Hardcoded sport-specific code | Use `sportConfig.ts` helpers |
| 7 | Visual changes without verification | Check http://localhost:3001/ |
| 8 | Guessing at preferences | Read this file or ASK |
| 9 | **Low contrast/invisible text** | **ALL text MUST be fully visible - see CRITICAL UI RULE below** |

---

## 🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL UI VISIBILITY RULE (HIGHEST PRIORITY) 🚨🚨🚨

> **THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. VIOLATING THIS WASTES THE USER'S TIME.**

### The Rule
**ALL text, icons, and UI elements MUST have sufficient contrast to be IMMEDIATELY and EASILY readable.** If a user has to squint, lean in, or ask "I can't see this" - YOU FAILED.

### Why This Matters
- Fegrox is a visual perfectionist
- Low contrast text = amateur work
- Every "I can't see this" complaint = wasted time fixing YOUR mistake
- This is BASIC UI competency - there is no excuse

### Enforcement Checklist (BEFORE shipping any UI):
| Element | Dark Background | Light Background |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Headings** | `text-white` or bright color + text-shadow | `text-slate-900` or `text-black` |
| **Body text** | `text-slate-200` minimum (NOT slate-400/500) | `text-slate-700` minimum |
| **Subtle text** | `text-slate-300` minimum | `text-slate-600` minimum |
| **Icons** | Bright/white with good contrast | Dark with good contrast |
| **Inside glass/cards** | ALWAYS explicit `text-white` or dark bg | ALWAYS explicit dark text |

### Common Mistakes to NEVER Make:
1. **Using `osys-glass` without checking text color** - glass often has light bg, text becomes invisible
2. **Using CSS classes that override inline colors** - always check what the class does
3. **Assuming text-white works everywhere** - verify visually
4. **Using slate-400, slate-500 on dark backgrounds** - TOO DIM, use slate-200/300 minimum
5. **Forgetting text color inside custom components** - GlassCard, modals, etc. need explicit text colors

### If You're Unsure:
- Use **inline styles** with explicit hex colors: `style={{ color: '#ffffff' }}`
- Add **text-shadow** for extra pop: `textShadow: '0 4px 20px rgba(255,255,255,0.3)'`
- TEST IN BROWSER before saying "done"

### Consequence
If the user says "I can't see this" or "this text is hard to read" - you made a mistake that should have been prevented. Apologize, fix it immediately, and learn from it.

## 🚀 SESSION WORKFLOW

### Starting a New Session
1. AI reads this file (or user shares it)
2. AI also reads `PROGRESS.md` (don't ask user to share)
3. AI says: **"Training loaded. Ready to build great."**
4. AI asks: **"What are we building?"**

### During a Session
1. Execute with excellence
2. Pre-test everything
3. Update docs in real-time
4. Be proactive - suggest improvements

### Ending a Session (when user says "save training")
1. Ask: "What lessons should I log?"
2. Add lessons to this file
3. Update `PROGRESS.md`
4. Confirm: "Logged X lessons. Progress updated."

---

## ⚡ QUICK COMMANDS

| I Say | You Do |
|-------|--------|
| "Let's build" | Start executing on current priority |
| "Show me progress" | Display from PROGRESS.md |
| "What's next?" | Tell me the next priority task |
| "Is this the best?" | Critically evaluate if world-class |
| "Think bigger" | Expand the feature to be more ambitious |
| "Ship it" | Done discussing, commit and move on |
| "Update docs" | Make sure all MD files reflect current state |
| "Save training" | Log lessons, update PROGRESS.md |

---

## 🔄 COMPOUND LEARNING (ALWAYS ON)

When catching amateur thinking:
1. **Log the lesson** - What was amateur and why
2. **Document the great way** - Correct pattern/solution
3. **Update this file** - Add to LESSONS LEARNED
4. **Compound** - Reference related lessons

---

## 📚 LESSONS LEARNED

### UX Lessons

**L001 - CTA Intent Matching** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** "Get Started Free" opened login tab
- **Great:** URL param `?signup=true` → signup form. Button text = destination.
- **Code:** `const initialSignUp = searchParams.get('signup') === 'true'`

### Process Lessons

**L002 - Single Source of Truth** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Created standalone training files
- **Great:** ALL training → this one file (AI_TRAINER.md)

**L003 - Auto-Read Files** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Ask user to share multiple MD files
- **Great:** AI reads PROGRESS.md itself, user only shares this file

### Architecture Lessons

**L004 - Always Use sportConfig.ts** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Hardcoded football stats in components
- **Great:** Import `getStats()`, `getPositions()`, `getSportConfig()` from `sportConfig.ts`
- **Code:**
  ```typescript
  import { getStats, getPositions } from '../components/stats/sportConfig';
  const stats = getStats(teamData?.sport);
  const positions = getPositions(teamData?.sport);
  ```

**L005 - Dynamic UI Based on Sport** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Fixed table headers, hardcoded stat names
- **Great:** Map over config arrays, render dynamically
- **Pattern:** `stats.map(stat => <th key={stat.key}>{stat.label}</th>)`

### Testing Lessons

**L006 - Visual Verification Required** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Code compiles = done
- **Great:** Always verify visually at http://localhost:3001/ before marking complete

**L007 - Session Context Preservation** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Long chats break, context lost between sessions
- **Great:** Update SESSION HANDOFF section in AI_TRAINER.md before ending session
- **User says:** "save training" or "update handoff" → AI updates this file
- **New chat:** User pastes `Read AI_TRAINER.md` → AI has full context

**L008 - Feature Parity Audits** (Dec 8, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Assume new UI is complete, miss features
- **Great:** Create comprehensive side-by-side comparison table of ALL features
- **Pattern:** Old Component vs New Component - list every feature, mark ✅/❌
- **Result:** Found 7 missing features (Go Live, Events, Edit Record, etc.) that were critical

**L009 - Component Props Investigation** (Dec 8, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Guess component props, cause build errors
- **Great:** Read component source to understand exact prop interface
- **Example:** GoLiveModal uses `useAuth()` internally - doesn't need coachId/coachName props
- **Example:** GlassCard doesn't accept `theme` prop - use wrapper div with theme classes

**L010 - Firebase Query Patterns** (Dec 8, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Assume single field structure
- **Great:** Handle both new and legacy data structures
- **Pattern:** Query by `teamIds` array-contains, but also check legacy `teamId` string field
- **Code:** `where('teamIds', 'array-contains', teamId)` + filter for `doc.data().teamId === teamId`

**L011 - Badge Component Constraints** (Jan 21, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Assume Badge has size prop and common variants like 'info', 'danger'
- **Great:** Check actual component props before using
- **Badge variants:** `'default' | 'primary' | 'gold' | 'success' | 'live' | 'coming' | 'warning' | 'error'`
- **NO size prop** - Use `className="text-xs"` instead
- **Mapping:** 'info' → 'warning', 'danger' → 'error'

**L012 - UserRole Type Case Sensitivity** (Jan 21, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Use lowercase role names like `'fan'`, `'coach'`
- **Great:** Check the exact UserRole type definition
- **Correct:** `'Coach' | 'Parent' | 'Fan' | 'SuperAdmin'` (capital first letter)
- **Pattern:** Always verify enum/type definitions in types.ts

**L013 - Required Type Fields** (Jan 21, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Assume you know what fields a type requires
- **Great:** Check service function signatures and type definitions
- **Example:** NILDeal requires `source: 'listing' | 'offer' | 'recorded' | 'legacy'`
- **Pattern:** When creating demo data, verify ALL required fields exist

**L014 - Button Component Variants** (Jan 21, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Use common variants like 'outline', 'secondary'
- **Great:** Check Button.tsx for actual supported variants
- **Button variants:** `'primary' | 'gold' | 'ghost'` (NO 'outline')
- **Pattern:** 'outline' → 'ghost'

**L015 - Self-Rating Communication** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Complete task without providing self-rating
- **Great:** ALWAYS provide 1-10 rating after EVERY task completion
- **Format:** Rating X/10, What went well, What could be better, Why not 9-10, Would I redo?
- **Rule:** If rating < 7, redo the work. User expects to see the rating without asking.

---

## 🏆 THE STANDARD

Every app we build together must:
1. **Dominate its market** - Not participate, dominate
2. **Make users dependent** - Switching should feel impossible
3. **Generate revenue** - Free doesn't build empires
4. **Scale infinitely** - Built for millions from day 1
5. **Delight users** - They should LOVE using it
6. **Be the best in the world** - No compromises

> **"We don't build apps. We build empires."**

## 📦 SESSION HANDOFF - CURRENT STATE

> **This section is the "brain dump" from the last session. New AI: Read this first!**

### Last Session: December 10, 2025

#### 🎨 V2 ATHLETE PROFILE REBUILD

**Discovered V2 premium athlete profile design existed in OSYSAthleteProfile.tsx but was never connected to routes. Created PublicAthleteProfileV2.tsx merging premium design with real Firebase data.**

#### ✅ COMPLETED THIS SESSION

1. **V2 Athlete Profile Discovery & Rebuild**
   - Found V2 mockups in `design-v2/athlete-profile.html` folder
   - Found `OSYSAthleteProfile.tsx` had premium V2 design but used MOCK DATA
   - Created `PublicAthleteProfileV2.tsx` (~1058 lines) merging:
     - Premium V2 design (yellow jersey card, animated purple background, stats bar, tabs)
     - Real Firebase data fetching from original PublicAthleteProfile.tsx
   - Updated `App.tsx` import to use V2 component (line 56)
   - Preserved backup as `PublicAthleteProfile.old.tsx`

2. **CSS Fixes for OSYS Design System**
   - Added missing `osys-bg-gradient` and `osys-bg-mesh` classes to `styles/osys-design-system.css`
   - Updated `AnimatedBackground` component with proper variants (cyber, mesh, gradient, sparkle)

3. **Premium Features in V2 Profile**
   - Yellow jersey number card with diagonal stripe pattern
   - Animated purple mesh background
   - Verified badge support
   - Online indicator
   - Badge row (Sportsmanship Star, Team Captain, Starter)
   - Social stats bar (Followers, Games, Highlights, Kudos)
   - Action buttons (Follow, Send Kudos, NIL Inquiry, Message)
   - Tab navigation (Stats, Posts, Highlights, Fundraising, Chat)
   - Recent games display
   - Career stats
   - Sidebar with team card and kudos

#### 🐛 BUG FIXES THIS SESSION

| Fix | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| V2 design not showing | OSYSAthleteProfile.tsx had V2 design but used mock data + wasn't connected to routes |
| Missing CSS classes | osys-bg-gradient, osys-bg-mesh not defined in osys-design-system.css |
| TypeScript errors | Fixed 12+ type assertions for properties like player.isVerified, team.emoji, etc. |

#### 🔧 KEY FILES MODIFIED

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `components/public/PublicAthleteProfileV2.tsx` | **NEW** - Premium V2 design + real Firebase data |
| `App.tsx` | Updated import to use PublicAthleteProfileV2 |
| `styles/osys-design-system.css` | Added osys-bg-gradient, osys-bg-mesh classes |
| `components/ui/OSYSComponents.tsx` | Updated AnimatedBackground variants |
| `PROGRESS.md` | Bug fix count to 105+, added changelog entries |

#### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

1. **DEV SERVER PORT**: Vite is running on port **3001** (not 3000) - check localhost:3001/athlete/kk
2. **BROWSER CACHE**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) may be needed to see V2 design
3. **V2 CONNECTED**: App.tsx now imports from `PublicAthleteProfileV2` - the premium design should show
4. **Similar V2 rebuilds may be needed**: PublicTeamProfile and PublicCoachProfile likely also have V2 versions

#### 🚧 NEXT UP

1. **VERIFY V2 IS SHOWING** - User needs to hard refresh localhost:3001 to see V2 athlete profile
2. Check if PublicTeamProfile and PublicCoachProfile need similar V2 upgrades
3. Continue pilot program preparation
4. Marketing Hub improvements
5. Age Groups & Draft System (PILOT BLOCKER)

**SVG Wheel Animation Pattern:**
```tsx
<svg viewBox="0 0 200 200">
  {teams.map((team, idx) => {
    const startAngle = idx * (360 / teams.length);
    const endAngle = (idx + 1) * (360 / teams.length);
    // Create pie segments with team colors
  })}
</svg>
```

#### 🚧 NEXT UP

1. Continue pilot program preparation
2. Test Draft Lottery on production at osys.team/draft
