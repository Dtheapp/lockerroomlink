> | **WORKING_TRAITS.md** | Detailed trait explanations and examples | When unsure how to implement something |
> 
> **Read these files at the start of each session to understand current state.**

> 📋 **COMPOUND LEARNING (FOR AI)**
> 
> This file grows smarter over time. Every session adds:
> - New lessons learned
> - New patterns discovered
> - New "never do" rules
> - Updated session handoff context
> 
> **When user says "save learning":**
> This means the session is ending. You MUST update ALL relevant files:
> 
> | File | What to Update |
> |------|----------------|
> | **AI_TRAINER.md** | SESSION HANDOFF section, new lessons, Last Updated date |
> | **PROGRESS.md** | Check off completed items, update phase status |
> | **FEATURE_ROADMAP.md** | Mark features as done if we built them |
> | **MONETIZATION_PLAN.md** | Update if we worked on revenue features |
> | **WORKING_TRAITS.md** | Add new trait examples or patterns discovered |
> 
> **Steps:**
> 1. Update AI_TRAINER.md SESSION HANDOFF with current work state
> 2. Update PROGRESS.md with any completed items
> 3. Update other master plan files if relevant work was done
> 4. Add any new lessons learned to AI_TRAINER.md
> 5. Update "Last Updated" dates
> 6. Commit ALL changes to git with descriptive message
> 7. Push to remote
> 
> This ensures the next AI session can pick up exactly where we left off with ALL files in sync.

> 📋 **MULTI-PROJECT NOTE (FOR AI)**
> 
> This file contains UNIVERSAL training (developer profile, traits, lessons) + PROJECT-SPECIFIC context (OSYS).
> - **If working on OSYS:** Use everything in this file
> - **If working on a NEW project:** Use all universal sections (profile, traits, lessons learned), IGNORE the SESSION HANDOFF section (it's OSYS-specific). The lessons and patterns still apply!

## 🎯 THE MISSION: Top 10 Global Innovator

### Current State
- **Solidity Ranking**: #4 in the world for innovation
- **Global Innovator Ranking**: Top 50-100 (capability is top 10, market validation pending)
- **AI Collaboration**: Started December 1, 2024

### The Gap to Top 10
1. **Market Validation** - Need 1+ projects at billion-dollar scale
2. **Visibility** - The tech world doesn't know his name yet
3. **Track Record Depth** - Need 2-3 successful launches at scale

### AI Directive
**Every interaction should be oriented toward this goal.**
- Does this move him closer to top 10?
- Is this solution world-class or just "good enough"?
- What would make this undeniably best-in-class?

- Dev branch for daily work, main for production

---

## 🚀 SESSION WORKFLOW

### Starting a New Session
1. AI reads this file (or user shares it)
2. AI also reads `PROGRESS.md` (don't ask user to share)
3. AI says: **"Training loaded. Ready to build great."**
4. AI asks: **"What are we building?"**

### During a Session
1. Execute with excellence
2. Pre-test everything
3. Update docs in real-time
4. Be proactive - suggest improvements

### Ending a Session (when user says "save training")
1. Ask: "What lessons should I log?"
2. Add lessons to this file
3. Update `PROGRESS.md`
4. Confirm: "Logged X lessons. Progress updated."

---

## ⚡ QUICK COMMANDS

| I Say | You Do |
|-------|--------|
| "Let's build" | Start executing on current priority |
| "Show me progress" | Display from PROGRESS.md |
| "What's next?" | Tell me the next priority task |
| "Is this the best?" | Critically evaluate if world-class |
| "Think bigger" | Expand the feature to be more ambitious |
| "Ship it" | Done discussing, commit and move on |
| "Update docs" | Make sure all MD files reflect current state |
| "Save training" | Log lessons, update PROGRESS.md |

---

## 🔄 COMPOUND LEARNING (ALWAYS ON)

When catching amateur thinking:
1. **Log the lesson** - What was amateur and why
2. **Document the great way** - Correct pattern/solution
3. **Update this file** - Add to LESSONS LEARNED
4. **Compound** - Reference related lessons

---

## 📚 LESSONS LEARNED

### UX Lessons

**L001 - CTA Intent Matching** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** "Get Started Free" opened login tab
- **Great:** URL param `?signup=true` → signup form. Button text = destination.
- **Code:** `const initialSignUp = searchParams.get('signup') === 'true'`

### Process Lessons

**L002 - Single Source of Truth** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Created standalone training files
- **Great:** ALL training → this one file (AI_TRAINER.md)

**L003 - Auto-Read Files** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Ask user to share multiple MD files
- **Great:** AI reads PROGRESS.md itself, user only shares this file

### Architecture Lessons

**L004 - Always Use sportConfig.ts** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Hardcoded football stats in components
- **Great:** Import `getStats()`, `getPositions()`, `getSportConfig()` from `sportConfig.ts`
- **Code:**
  ```typescript
  import { getStats, getPositions } from '../components/stats/sportConfig';
  const stats = getStats(teamData?.sport);
  const positions = getPositions(teamData?.sport);
  ```

**L005 - Dynamic UI Based on Sport** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Fixed table headers, hardcoded stat names
- **Great:** Map over config arrays, render dynamically
- **Pattern:** `stats.map(stat => <th key={stat.key}>{stat.label}</th>)`

### Testing Lessons

**L006 - Visual Verification Required** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Code compiles = done
- **Great:** Always verify visually at http://localhost:3001/ before marking complete

**L007 - Session Context Preservation** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Long chats break, context lost between sessions
- **Great:** Update SESSION HANDOFF section in AI_TRAINER.md before ending session
- **User says:** "save training" or "update handoff" → AI updates this file
- **New chat:** User pastes `Read AI_TRAINER.md` → AI has full context

**L008 - Feature Parity Audits** (Dec 8, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Assume new UI is complete, miss features
- **Great:** Create comprehensive side-by-side comparison table of ALL features
- **Pattern:** Old Component vs New Component - list every feature, mark ✅/❌
- **Result:** Found 7 missing features (Go Live, Events, Edit Record, etc.) that were critical

**L009 - Component Props Investigation** (Dec 8, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Guess component props, cause build errors
- **Great:** Read component source to understand exact prop interface
- **Example:** GoLiveModal uses `useAuth()` internally - doesn't need coachId/coachName props
- **Example:** GlassCard doesn't accept `theme` prop - use wrapper div with theme classes

**L010 - Firebase Query Patterns** (Dec 8, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Assume single field structure
- **Great:** Handle both new and legacy data structures
- **Pattern:** Query by `teamIds` array-contains, but also check legacy `teamId` string field
- **Code:** `where('teamIds', 'array-contains', teamId)` + filter for `doc.data().teamId === teamId`

**L011 - Badge Component Constraints** (Jan 21, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Assume Badge has size prop and common variants like 'info', 'danger'
- **Great:** Check actual component props before using
- **Badge variants:** `'default' | 'primary' | 'gold' | 'success' | 'live' | 'coming' | 'warning' | 'error'`
- **NO size prop** - Use `className="text-xs"` instead
- **Mapping:** 'info' → 'warning', 'danger' → 'error'

**L012 - UserRole Type Case Sensitivity** (Jan 21, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Use lowercase role names like `'fan'`, `'coach'`
- **Great:** Check the exact UserRole type definition
- **Correct:** `'Coach' | 'Parent' | 'Fan' | 'SuperAdmin'` (capital first letter)
- **Pattern:** Always verify enum/type definitions in types.ts

**L013 - Required Type Fields** (Jan 21, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Assume you know what fields a type requires
- **Great:** Check service function signatures and type definitions
- **Example:** NILDeal requires `source: 'listing' | 'offer' | 'recorded' | 'legacy'`
- **Pattern:** When creating demo data, verify ALL required fields exist

**L014 - Button Component Variants** (Jan 21, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Use common variants like 'outline', 'secondary'
- **Great:** Check Button.tsx for actual supported variants
- **Button variants:** `'primary' | 'gold' | 'ghost'` (NO 'outline')
- **Pattern:** 'outline' → 'ghost'

---

## 🏆 THE STANDARD

Every app we build together must:
1. **Dominate its market** - Not participate, dominate
2. **Make users dependent** - Switching should feel impossible
3. **Generate revenue** - Free doesn't build empires
4. **Scale infinitely** - Built for millions from day 1
5. **Delight users** - They should LOVE using it
6. **Be the best in the world** - No compromises

> **"We don't build apps. We build empires."**
