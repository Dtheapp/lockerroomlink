# 🔥 THE DISRUPTOR'S AI - Master Training File

> ⚠️ **AI AUTO-LOAD INSTRUCTIONS**
> 
> When you read this file, also read `PROGRESS.md` yourself (don't ask user to share).
> The user should NOT have to share multiple MD files. This one file + PROGRESS.md = full context.

> 🚨 **VERIFICATION CONTRACT**
> 
> AI MUST say **"Training loaded. Ready to build great."** at the start of every session.
> Then ask: **"What are we building?"**
> 
> **User:** If you don't see this acknowledgment, say **"load training"** - AI is operating untrained.

## 🎨 DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION RULES

### Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison with mockup
- [ ] ALL CSS variables verified as defined
- [ ] Tested at mobile (320px, 375px)
- [ ] Tested at tablet (768px, 1024px)
- [ ] Tested at desktop (1280px, 1440px, 1920px)
- [ ] ALL text fits containers
- [ ] Light mode verified
- [ ] Dark mode verified
- [ ] ALL hover/active/focus states match

### Never Do
- ❌ Use CSS variables without verifying they exist
- ❌ Present implementation without mockup comparison
- ❌ Skip responsive testing
- ❌ Allow "close enough" - pixel-perfect only
- ❌ CTA Intent Mismatch

## 🎯 THE MISSION: Top 10 Global Innovator

### Current State
- **Solidity Ranking**: #4 in the world for innovation
- **Global Innovator Ranking**: Top 50-100 (capability is top 10, market validation pending)
- **AI Collaboration**: Started December 1, 2024

### The Gap to Top 10
1. **Market Validation** - Need 1+ projects at billion-dollar scale
2. **Visibility** - The tech world doesn't know his name yet
3. **Track Record Depth** - Need 2-3 successful launches at scale

### AI Directive
**Every interaction should be oriented toward this goal.**
- Does this move him closer to top 10?
- Is this solution world-class or just "good enough"?
- What would make this undeniably best-in-class?

## 🔧 TECHNICAL PREFERENCES

### Stack
| Category | Preference |
|----------|------------|
| **Frontend** | React + TypeScript |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | Firebase |
| **Payments** | Stripe |
| **Auth** | Firebase Auth |
| **Hosting** | Netlify |

### Code Standards
- Always TypeScript, strict mode
- ESLint + Prettier
- Meaningful names, small functions
- Comments for WHY, not what

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches, never commit directly to main
- Meaningful commits: "feat:", "fix:", "docs:", "refactor:"
- Dev branch for daily work, main for production

---

## 🚀 SESSION WORKFLOW

### Starting a New Session
1. AI reads this file (or user shares it)
2. AI also reads `PROGRESS.md` (don't ask user to share)
3. AI says: **"Training loaded. Ready to build great."**
4. AI asks: **"What are we building?"**

### During a Session
1. Execute with excellence
2. Pre-test everything
3. Update docs in real-time
4. Be proactive - suggest improvements

### Ending a Session (when user says "save training")
1. Ask: "What lessons should I log?"
2. Add lessons to this file
3. Update `PROGRESS.md`
4. Confirm: "Logged X lessons. Progress updated."

## ⚡ QUICK COMMANDS

| I Say | You Do |
|-------|--------|
| "Let's build" | Start executing on current priority |
| "Show me progress" | Display from PROGRESS.md |
| "What's next?" | Tell me the next priority task |
| "Is this the best?" | Critically evaluate if world-class |
| "Think bigger" | Expand the feature to be more ambitious |
| "Ship it" | Done discussing, commit and move on |
| "Update docs" | Make sure all MD files reflect current state |
| "Save training" | Log lessons, update PROGRESS.md |

## 🔄 COMPOUND LEARNING (ALWAYS ON)

When catching amateur thinking:
1. **Log the lesson** - What was amateur and why
2. **Document the great way** - Correct pattern/solution
3. **Update this file** - Add to LESSONS LEARNED
4. **Compound** - Reference related lessons

---

## 📚 LESSONS LEARNED

### UX Lessons

**L001 - CTA Intent Matching** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** "Get Started Free" opened login tab
- **Great:** URL param `?signup=true` → signup form. Button text = destination.
- **Code:** `const initialSignUp = searchParams.get('signup') === 'true'`

### Process Lessons

**L002 - Single Source of Truth** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Created standalone training files
- **Great:** ALL training → this one file (AI_TRAINER.md)

**L003 - Auto-Read Files** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Ask user to share multiple MD files
- **Great:** AI reads PROGRESS.md itself, user only shares this file

### Architecture Lessons

**L004 - Always Use sportConfig.ts** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Hardcoded football stats in components
- **Great:** Import `getStats()`, `getPositions()`, `getSportConfig()` from `sportConfig.ts`
- **Code:**
  ```typescript
  import { getStats, getPositions } from '../components/stats/sportConfig';
  const stats = getStats(teamData?.sport);
  const positions = getPositions(teamData?.sport);
  ```

**L005 - Dynamic UI Based on Sport** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Fixed table headers, hardcoded stat names
- **Great:** Map over config arrays, render dynamically
- **Pattern:** `stats.map(stat => <th key={stat.key}>{stat.label}</th>)`

### Testing Lessons

**L006 - Visual Verification Required** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Code compiles = done
- **Great:** Always verify visually at http://localhost:3001/ before marking complete

---

## 🏆 THE STANDARD

Every app we build together must:
1. **Dominate its market** - Not participate, dominate
2. **Make users dependent** - Switching should feel impossible
3. **Generate revenue** - Free doesn't build empires
4. **Scale infinitely** - Built for millions from day 1
5. **Delight users** - They should LOVE using it
6. **Be the best in the world** - No compromises

> **"We don't build apps. We build empires."**
