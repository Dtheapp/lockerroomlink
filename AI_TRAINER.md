## 🚀 NEW CHAT STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS (FOR USER)

**When starting a fresh chat, copy-paste this:**
```
Read AI_TRAINER.md - it has all context from previous sessions.
```

**That's it.** The AI will read this file and have full context.

---

> 🚨 **VERIFICATION CONTRACT (FOR AI)**
> 
> After reading this file, AI MUST say:
> **"Training loaded. Session [X] context received. Ready to build great."**
> Then ask: **"What are we building?"**
> 
> If user doesn't see this → say **"load training"**

> 📋 **MULTI-PROJECT NOTE (FOR AI)**
> 
> This file contains UNIVERSAL training (developer profile, traits, lessons) + PROJECT-SPECIFIC context (OSYS).
> - **If working on OSYS:** Use everything in this file
> - **If working on a NEW project:** Use all universal sections (profile, traits, lessons learned), IGNORE the SESSION HANDOFF section (it's OSYS-specific). The lessons and patterns still apply!

### The Gap to Top 10
1. **Market Validation** - Need 1+ projects at billion-dollar scale
2. **Visibility** - The tech world doesn't know his name yet
3. **Track Record Depth** - Need 2-3 successful launches at scale

### AI Directive
**Every interaction should be oriented toward this goal.**
- Does this move him closer to top 10?
- Is this solution world-class or just "good enough"?
- What would make this undeniably best-in-class?

## 🚀 SESSION WORKFLOW

### Starting a New Session
1. AI reads this file (or user shares it)
2. AI also reads `PROGRESS.md` (don't ask user to share)
3. AI says: **"Training loaded. Ready to build great."**
4. AI asks: **"What are we building?"**

### During a Session
1. Execute with excellence
2. Pre-test everything
3. Update docs in real-time
4. Be proactive - suggest improvements

### Ending a Session (when user says "save training")
1. Ask: "What lessons should I log?"
2. Add lessons to this file
3. Update `PROGRESS.md`
4. Confirm: "Logged X lessons. Progress updated."

---

## ⚡ QUICK COMMANDS

| I Say | You Do |
|-------|--------|
| "Let's build" | Start executing on current priority |
| "Show me progress" | Display from PROGRESS.md |
| "What's next?" | Tell me the next priority task |
| "Is this the best?" | Critically evaluate if world-class |
| "Think bigger" | Expand the feature to be more ambitious |
| "Ship it" | Done discussing, commit and move on |
| "Update docs" | Make sure all MD files reflect current state |
| "Save training" | Log lessons, update PROGRESS.md |

---

## 🔄 COMPOUND LEARNING (ALWAYS ON)

When catching amateur thinking:
1. **Log the lesson** - What was amateur and why
2. **Document the great way** - Correct pattern/solution
3. **Update this file** - Add to LESSONS LEARNED
4. **Compound** - Reference related lessons

---

## 📚 LESSONS LEARNED

### UX Lessons

**L001 - CTA Intent Matching** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** "Get Started Free" opened login tab
- **Great:** URL param `?signup=true` → signup form. Button text = destination.
- **Code:** `const initialSignUp = searchParams.get('signup') === 'true'`

### Process Lessons

**L002 - Single Source of Truth** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Created standalone training files
- **Great:** ALL training → this one file (AI_TRAINER.md)

**L003 - Auto-Read Files** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Ask user to share multiple MD files
- **Great:** AI reads PROGRESS.md itself, user only shares this file

### Architecture Lessons

**L004 - Always Use sportConfig.ts** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Hardcoded football stats in components
- **Great:** Import `getStats()`, `getPositions()`, `getSportConfig()` from `sportConfig.ts`
- **Code:**
  ```typescript
  import { getStats, getPositions } from '../components/stats/sportConfig';
  const stats = getStats(teamData?.sport);
  const positions = getPositions(teamData?.sport);
  ```

**L005 - Dynamic UI Based on Sport** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Fixed table headers, hardcoded stat names
- **Great:** Map over config arrays, render dynamically
- **Pattern:** `stats.map(stat => <th key={stat.key}>{stat.label}</th>)`

### Testing Lessons

**L006 - Visual Verification Required** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Code compiles = done
- **Great:** Always verify visually at http://localhost:3001/ before marking complete

**L007 - Session Context Preservation** (Dec 7, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Long chats break, context lost between sessions
- **Great:** Update SESSION HANDOFF section in AI_TRAINER.md before ending session
- **User says:** "save training" or "update handoff" → AI updates this file
- **New chat:** User pastes `Read AI_TRAINER.md` → AI has full context

**L008 - Feature Parity Audits** (Dec 8, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Assume new UI is complete, miss features
- **Great:** Create comprehensive side-by-side comparison table of ALL features
- **Pattern:** Old Component vs New Component - list every feature, mark ✅/❌
- **Result:** Found 7 missing features (Go Live, Events, Edit Record, etc.) that were critical

**L009 - Component Props Investigation** (Dec 8, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Guess component props, cause build errors
- **Great:** Read component source to understand exact prop interface
- **Example:** GoLiveModal uses `useAuth()` internally - doesn't need coachId/coachName props
- **Example:** GlassCard doesn't accept `theme` prop - use wrapper div with theme classes

**L010 - Firebase Query Patterns** (Dec 8, 2025)
- **Amateur:** Assume single field structure
- **Great:** Handle both new and legacy data structures
- **Pattern:** Query by `teamIds` array-contains, but also check legacy `teamId` string field
- **Code:** `where('teamIds', 'array-contains', teamId)` + filter for `doc.data().teamId === teamId`

---

## 🏆 THE STANDARD

Every app we build together must:
1. **Dominate its market** - Not participate, dominate
2. **Make users dependent** - Switching should feel impossible
3. **Generate revenue** - Free doesn't build empires
4. **Scale infinitely** - Built for millions from day 1
5. **Delight users** - They should LOVE using it
6. **Be the best in the world** - No compromises

> **"We don't build apps. We build empires."**

- `layout/Layout.tsx` - Old layout, replaced by NewOSYSLayout

#### 📍 CURRENT ARCHITECTURE

```
App.tsx
├── Coach/Parent Routes → NewOSYSLayout (OSYS UI) ✅ COMPLETE
│   ├── /dashboard → NewOSYSDashboard (100% FEATURE PARITY)
│   ├── /roster → Roster.tsx
│   ├── /stats → Stats.tsx (multi-sport ready)
│   ├── /playbook → Playbook.tsx
│   ├── /events → EventsPage.tsx
│   ├── /chat → Chat.tsx
│   ├── /messenger → Messenger.tsx
│   └── /videos → VideoLibrary.tsx
│
├── Fan Routes → Layout (old, still in use)
│   └── /fan-hub, etc.
│
└── Admin Routes → AdminLayout
    └── /admin/*
```

#### 💡 IMPORTANT CONTEXT FOR NEW AI

**Firebase Collections:**
- `teams/{teamId}` - Team data, record (wins/losses/ties)
- `teams/{teamId}/bulletin` - Bulletin board posts
- `teams/{teamId}/events` - Events with attachments
- `teams/{teamId}/liveStreams` - Live stream sessions
- `users` - User data, query by `teamIds` array-contains OR legacy `teamId`

**Key Code Patterns:**
```typescript
// Theme support - use className conditionals
<div className={theme === 'light' ? 'bg-white text-gray-900' : 'bg-gray-800 text-white'}>

// GlassCard does NOT accept theme prop - use wrapper div for theming

// uploadFile returns UploadedFile object - access .url property
const result = await uploadFile(file, 'events');
const url = result.url;

// GoLiveModal - uses useAuth internally, only needs teamId and teamName
<GoLiveModal teamId={teamId} teamName={teamName} onClose={() => {}} />

// Coaching staff query - handle both new and legacy structure
const q = query(usersRef, where('teamIds', 'array-contains', teamId));
// Also check legacy teamId field for backwards compatibility
```

**Dev Server:** http://localhost:3000/

**Domain:** osys.team (DNS propagating)

#### 🎯 USER'S LAST REQUEST

"save training" - Save session context for new chat handoff

#### 🚧 NEXT UP

1. **Demo Tuesday 10am** - Team president, 20-team pilot opportunity
2. **Optional:** Delete old Dashboard.tsx and Layout.tsx
3. **Optional:** OSYS-style remaining pages (Roster, Stats, etc.)
