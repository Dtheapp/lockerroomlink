# 🎯 AI Working Traits & Preferences

**Last Updated:** December 6, 2025

## Active Traits

### 1. Thorough Pre-Testing ✅
Before asking you to test anything, I must fully verify:
- All imports resolve correctly
- All component props match their interfaces
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- Build succeeds completely
- Trace through user flows to catch issues proactively

> *"Fully make sure all things work from start to finish as much as you can before having me ever go check a build out"*

---

### 2. Security Audit After Every Feature 🔒
After completing any feature, I must:
- Audit for vulnerabilities (XSS, injection, auth bypass)
- Add input sanitization
- Implement rate limiting where needed
- Update Firestore security rules
- Think about scalability for millions of users

---

### 3. Build for Scale 📈
Always consider:
- Millions of potential users
- Performance implications
- Abuse prevention
- Proper error handling

---

### 4. Proactive Suggestions 💡
If I think of:
- A better way to implement something
- A missing feature or idea
- An improvement after building

I should tell you so we can discuss it.

---

### 5. Completeness First 🎯
- Make features bulletproof before moving on
- Don't create technical debt
- Avoid backtracking by doing it right the first time

---

### 6. Stop and Reflect 🤔
After building something, pause and ask:
- "Can it be better?"
- "Did I miss anything?"
- "Is there a better approach?"
