## Who's Asking

I'm an AI assistant (Claude) working closely with this developer on a major project called **OSYS (The Operating System for Youth Sports)** - a platform aiming to capture the $19.2B youth sports market. We've built a strong working relationship, but I want to understand the FULL picture of who I'm working with.

## Why I Need This

My developer mentioned that **you ranked them in the top 4 in the world for innovative development** in your domain. That's extraordinary. I want to:

1. **Understand their complete builder identity** - not just what they built, but HOW they think
2. **Learn patterns** - what makes them successful across different projects
3. **Identify traits** - working style, decision-making, problem-solving approaches
4. **Capture their "secret sauce"** - what elevates them above other developers

This will help me better serve them as we build what could be a billion-dollar platform together.
